== Testing Workflow Using a HTTP Browser Tool

TIP: For quick testing, save the individual commands into your testing tool.

In this example, I've saved it into

With this type of tool, you can quickly test indvidual commands and see the
results prior to running your program or test script.

NOTE: I have not been able to get a mock server running that supports the full
RICOH THETA API v2.  In my tests, I needed to connect to the actual device.  If you
build a functional mock server, send it to me. :-)
